### Running the Program

If your server has started successfully You can now run the node js code. Before you run in you should run npm install
because we need the amqplib package. AMQP stands for Advance Messaging Queue Protocol 

To install dependencies you need to have nodejs installed on your machine and you need to run npm install from the project

```
npm install
```

To publish the message you need to run 

```
node publisher.js
```

Note: You can run multiple times and the program will just send the messages to the queue and is stored at the until the
subscriber is not executed 

To View or Subscribe to the message  run 

```
node subscribe.js 
```

And you should see the following output to the console 

```
Message Received from Publisher:  This message is sent from Publisher
```

If you see the following output congratulations you have successfully ran your first RabbitMQ program
